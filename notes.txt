This are the tasks I want to do

Option 1(Single Thread Multithread)::one after the other.Always complete one thing before
          starting the next task
Option 2(Multithread)::I will complete all the tasks in such a way that I "Practically start all of them at the same time"
          but keep juggling them based on some criteria""here Criteria ==conditions"
Option 3(Parallel execution)::Map number of tasks amongst number of avialable "workers"[threading but check number
          of cores first]Conditions applicable ::tasks should be independent 
Option 4(Asynchronous Execution)::Start a task.Either delegate to another worker or do it yourself  aFter sometime
         If someone else is doing a task,monitor it,wait for their work to be done,
         take follow -up actions accordingly
